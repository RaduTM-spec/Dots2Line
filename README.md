# Dots2Line
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.1.2-blue)
**Dots2Line** is a mobile app that simulates the learning process of neural networks. There are 2 main types of learning available: regression and classification. The user creates it's own dataset on a grid, sets the hyperparameters and runs the learning process. 

Depending on the performance of your device, it is recommended to adjust the network structure: decrease number of units per hidden layer and number of hidden layers, even setting ReLU as activation function in rare situations.



##### Future work
The app might receive updates including different neural network architectures that can be used (e.g. RNN, LSTM), improving performance and classification prediction resolution or digit/object recognition (based on ANN or CNN). The project files along with source code will be available soon.
